WWW::Mechanize::FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions about WWW::Mechanize

=head1 How do I do X?

=head2 Can I do [such-and-such] with WWW::Mechanize?

If it's possible with LWP::UserAgent, then yes.  WWW::Mechanize is
a subclass of L<LWP::UserAgent>, so all the wondrous magic of that
class is inherited.

=head2 How do I use WWW::Mechanize through a proxy server?

See the docs in L<LWP::UserAgent> on how to use the proxy.  Short version:

    $mech->proxy(['http', 'ftp'], 'http://proxy.example.com:8000/');

or get the specs from the environment:

    $mech->env_proxy();

    # Environment set like so:
    gopher_proxy=http://proxy.my.place/
    wais_proxy=http://proxy.my.place/
    no_proxy="localhost,my.domain"
    export gopher_proxy wais_proxy no_proxy

=head2 How can I see what fields are on the forms?

Use the mech-dump utility, optionaly installed with Mechanize.

    $ mech-dump --forms http://search.cpan.org
    Dumping forms
    GET http://search.cpan.org/search
      query=
      mode=all                        (option)  [*all|module|dist|author]
      <NONAME>=CPAN Search            (submit) 

=head2 How do I get Mech to handle authentication?

    my $agent = WWW::Mechanize->new();
    my @args = (
        Authorization => "Basic " .
            MIME::Base64::encode( USER . ':' . PASS )
    );

    $agent->credentials( ADDRESS, REALM, USER, PASS );
    $agent->get( URL, @args );

=head2 How can I get WWW::Mechanize to execute this JavaScript?

You can't.  JavaScript is entirely client-based, and WWW::Mechanize
is a client that doesn't understand JavaScript.

=head2 How do I handle frames?

You don't deal with them as frames, per se, but as links.  Extract
them with

    my @frame_links = $mech->find_link( tag => "frame" );

=head2 How do I get a list of HTTP headers and their values?

All L<HTTP::Headers> methods work on a L<HTTP::Response> object which is
returned by the I<get()>, I<reload()>, I<response()/res()>, I<click()>,
I<submit_form()>, and I<request()> methods.

    my $mech = WWW::Mechanize->new( autocheck => 1 );
    $mech->get( 'http://my.site.com' );
    my $res = $mech->response();
    for my $key ( $response->header_field_names() ) {
        print $key, " : ", $response->header( $key ), "\n";
    }

=head1 Why doesn't this work?

=head2 Why don't https:// URLs work?

You need either L<IO::Socket::SSL> or L<Crypt::SSLeay> installed.

=head2 Why do I get "Input 'fieldname' is readonly"?

You're trying to change the value of a hidden field and you have
warnings on.

First, make sure that you actually mean to change the field that you're
changing, and that you don't have a typo.  Usually, hidden variables are
set by the site you're working on for a reason.  If you change the value,
you might be breaking some functionality by faking it out.

If you really do want to change a hidden value, make the changes in a
scope that has warnings turned off:

    {
    local $^W = 0;
    $agent->field( name => $value );
    }

=head2 I tried to [such-and-such] and I got this weird error.

Are you checking your errors?

Are you sure?

Are you checking that your action succeeded after every action?

Are you sure?

For example, if you try this:

    $mech->get( "http://my.site.com" );
    $mech->follow_link( "foo" );

and the C<get> call fails for some reason, then the Mech internals
will be unusable for the C<follow_link> and you'll get a weird
error.  You B<must>, after every action that GETs or POSTs a page,
check that Mech succeeded, or all bets are off.

    $mech->get( "http://my.site.com" );
    die "Can't even get the home page: ", $mech->response->status_line
        unless $mech->success;

    $mech->follow_link( "foo" );
    die "Foo link failed: ", $mech->response->status_line
        unless $mech->success;
